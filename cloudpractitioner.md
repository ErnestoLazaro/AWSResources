### Domain 1: Cloud Concepts
* Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition

Traditional datacenters, inside of an organization are expensive - they contain equipment (servers, switches, hardware, etc...) plus the people to manage and maintain it. If you want to expand into a new area or a new geographic region, you're going to have to financial support a new set of equipment and a new datacenter at that location. Obtaining funding through investors or traditional banking requires time. Building things also takes a lot of time. Then once you have the funding to purchase the equipment and have built it, you have to hire people in the new location to manage and maintain it. To continue expanding your business around the globe you would have to continue this process.

You're also adding to your own technical debt. You have to plan financially to not only support future growth of your datacenters but you have to plan for upgrades and replacement of older tech as your datacenter ages.

Forecasting demand is also challenging - we need to understand what are we using now (what kind of capacity do we need) and what are we going to be using in the future (as our business grows). Businesses struggle with knowing how many users they will need to support in the future, how their internal business needs might change and how their market might fluctuate over time. 

When we're looking at traditional data centers, it takes an intial (large) up-front investment to get it up and running. Then there is a time commitment involved for funding and building. As well as the committment to people and technical debt.

Compliance burden - With every new datacenter you bring online, you have to have people who are experienced in security and data auditing to ensure that you are keeping your data safe and that it is held within the guidelines of your business expectations/legal requirements.

* Benfits of Cloud Computing
1. Key Advantages
   1. Trade capital expense for variable expense - We don't have a large investment of equipment initially like we would in a datacenter. In this case, you would get variable expenses based on usage. You don't have to pay for the equipment or installation, etc...you only pay for the time you're using or accessing the equipment. 
   1. Economies of scale - AWS purchases equipment at a much lower cost due to the volume and quantity they are purchasing from manufacturers. This means that they can buy things much cheaper than your business. Amazon is going to be sure to get the best price for their equipment in a way you cannot. Amazon has the capacity to manage all of the servers at scale and that cost savings gets passed down to the consumer (that's you!). 
   1. Capacity - Your business no longer has to worry about forecasting capacity. System and server demand in the cloud can either grow or shrink based on your needs. If your business is growing and needs more capacity it is easy to bring up more servers or equipment to support that. If your business is in a slump, you can scale-back your usage to ensure cost savings at that critical time for your business.
   1. Increased speed and agility - Obtaining funds for a traditional capital purchase such a datacenter or equipment you might need, can be very slow. If your business is growing very quickly you want to be able to support additional users or demand on your services at that time without waiting for traditional methods. This allows your business to compete better in your market. Additionally, what if you want to test a new market or a hypothesis about your users, traditional methods may not allow you to do that quickly. 
   1. Elasticity - You can aquire resources when you need them and release them when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to be able to expand and contract your resources on demand, automatically. AWS has several services available to do this. 
   1. Reliability - The AWS global infrastructure is built with reliability in mind and you take advantage of it by default. 


* Types of Cloud Computing
  * What is cloud computing? - AWS says that cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing, and that pricing model is critical to business success. 
  
* The Cloud Spectrum
* Full Control Datacenter ---- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) ---- Platform as a Service (PaaS) ---- Software as a Service (Saas)

* Infrastructure as a Service 
  * Servers in the cloud (virtual servers)  - We have full access to these server
  * You have to perform your own maintenance

* Platform as a Service
  * We're given a service that is configured for us and we can deploy our customizations (Wordpress host)

* Software as a Service
  * Software you use or run as part of your business
  * Don't have to worry about servers or configuration, it's just provided as a service
